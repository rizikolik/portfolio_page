                    <p> Hi and Welcome to My Website! </p>
                    <p>I studied the university in the Turkish Military Academy.I graduated in 2015 as an artillery officer and as an Industrial Engineer.
                    I am married , have a daughter and i love my family .
                    I began to learn code in February 2019.After that i wrote code almost every day and sometimes 18 hours in a day.
                    After learning basic skills i decided to become a full stack developer.
                    While learning how to code ,i got Free Code Camp's Javascript and Algorithms and Responsive Web Design Certifications.
                    Also , i was accepted a full time , remote bootcamp ,Microverse,
                    but because of the financial problems i canceled my seat at the Microverse.
                    I used open source and internet for learning.I am looking for a company that push me learn  new things everyday.I am looking for a company that i can use the experience of my collegues, my superiors.
                    Learning new skills and writing code is my purpose .I am hungry to learn .</p>

                    <p>After the graduation from the Military Academy , i started work in the Army .My duty was managing the ploons at the beginning .Then i was promoted to Captain, company leader.
                    I worked about 4 years. I was managing 50-60 people at the same time and sometimes i was going to go the operations.

                    <h3>Microverse</h3>
                     <h5>Full Time Remote Bootcamp Student</h5>
                    <p> Microverse is an online bootcamp that only accepts 1% of the applicants.I made 12 hours pair programming at the application process.
                    When you start to Microverse you have a partner and you make pair programming for almost 6 months .
                    At the application process i solved some algorithms tests also.Before the course begin, i was wanting to be more prepared so i already learned node,mongoDB, express etc.
                    But in Microverse you have to commit at least 8 hours in a day .Because i had some financial problems , i canceled .
                    I had to take of my family.After that day i kept learning by myself.</p>
