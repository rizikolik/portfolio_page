                    <p>In February 2019, I  began to learn code.At that time i was trying to get accepted to Microverse.I learned HTML,CSS,Bootsrap,and JavaScript in 1 month for this program. .It is an online bootcamp that only accepts 1% of the applicants.I made 12 hours pair programming at the application process.
                      They accepted me as a student but after that i canceled this because of financial proplems.I had to work for my family.So without a community i began to learn myself.I used Udemy ,Free Code Camp,Codecacademy ,The Odin Project,Youtube,Khan Academy and other online sources.
                      Within this time i worked as a bread distributor for a bakery  and as an export sales man  for an export company.Within my free times i learnt my skills and improved them.I learned MERN stack and basic level sql.
